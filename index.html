            <div class="p1"> 
                <h2>The HTML:</h2>
                <p>I started with a div stucture that seperated the content into 
                    header, navigation bar, paragraphs 1-3, sidebar, and footer. The navigation 
                    bar is an unordered list of buttons. I laid out the divs in descending order 
                    how of they would appear in the browser. 
                    I also put the entire body into a grid container div, so that I could apply
                    grid formatting to the CSS. 
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="p2"> 
                <h2>The CSS:</h2>
                <p>Learning how to do layouts in CSS was kind of a challenge. I first tried to 
                    lay things out purely with 'float' and 'display: inline', but that was proving very
                    difficult. I decided to look into the grid layout instead, and went with that for 
                    the structure of all 3 formats. To use the grid functionality in CSS, I put all
                    of what I wanted to lay out in 1 div that acts as the grid container. I then specified
                    the dimensions of each child div within the grid container with the grid-area shorthand. 
                    After everything was laid out, I applied additional styling like background color, 
                    rounded borders, font families, etc.  

                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="p3"> 
                <h2>The JavaScript</h2>
                <p>I used Javascript to add the toggle theme functionality to the navigation buttons. 
                    I thought this would be complicated, but it was quite simple. I added a function that
                    takes a value (which is the 'href' value of the stylesheets) to the head of the HTML. 
                    The function creates a variable 'sheets' that stores a link from the HTML. 
                    Each time a button is clicked, the href value of the desired stylesheet is passed to the function, 
                    and the href value of sheets[0] (the first link) is changed to the value passed. In short,
                    the function changes the linked stylesheet which allows themes to be toggled.
